# Introductions
## Thank the sponsors
### Klaviyo
I looked at the website, and I still have no clue what you guys do,
but I am pretty sure it can help me make money... somehow...

### Here
A technology company that doesn't end in ".com"!

## Who am I?
B.S. & M.S. in Meteorology from Penn State
 - learned Perl, C/C++, MatLab & a terrible language called GrADS
 - discovered Linux and Vim and never looked back
 - so many software tools for meteorologists are written for Linux

Spent 5 years in PhD hell at the University of Oklahoma
 - Ran into all sorts of problems with MatLab
 - Colleague suggested that I try Matplotlib & Python
 - Within a couple of months, I managed to convert every single
   MatLab script of mine into Python
 - Kept on developing my research using those tools, and posting
   patches to the various mailing lists (pre-GitHub days).

Matplotlib Developer
 - Finally, John Hunter of Matplotlib said I annoyed him enough
   that he gave me commit rights.
 - Personally managed the v1.1.0 release of Matplotlib
 - Very active on the mpl mailing list

The matplotlib mailing list is directly responsible for two things:
 -- Me not finishing my dissertation
 -- Current job
 - http://matplotlib.1069221.n5.nabble.com/How-matplotlib-got-me-a-job-td27470.html
 - tl;dr; answer questions on mailing lists, you never know if the person
   you are helping out will be your next co-worker!

## What is AER?
We are a research-oriented company focusing on observational data
of all kinds -- surface, radar, hydrological and satellite data.
We also work closely with many companies around the world to study how
the weather and climate impacts their business.

We are primarially a Python shop, and our researchers use many other tools
as well. We have a mix of Linux, Mac and Windows environments.

We are looking to hire a few devops people with Linux experience!
You don't need to know a thing about meteorology
 -- just have a willingness to learn Python!
